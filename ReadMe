Question:

Hello, team!
We got an email from google play about violations of their rules. They told us that we place
interstitial ads so that they suddenly appear when a user is focused on a task at hand (e.g.
playing a game, filling out a form, reading content) may lead to accidental clicks and often
creates a frustrating user experience(see on the screenshot below).
Could you please describe how we can fix it?
Kind regards,

Answer:

Hello,...
In order not to have problems with Google Play about interstitial ads,you just don't need to 
call "show" methods in your code when user viewing content,playing a game,filling out a form,
and use intestitial ads only when navigating between pages.
Kind regards,
